GPU virtualization enables users to switch between the integrated and discrete graphics cards dynamically, depending on the workload and power consumption. This way, users can save battery life when running less demanding tasks, and unleash the full potential of their discrete graphics card when running more intensive ones.
 
Virtual Vsync is a feature that eliminates the screen tearing effect that occurs when the frame rate of the game exceeds the refresh rate of the monitor. It also prevents the performance drop that occurs when using traditional Vsync, which locks the frame rate to the refresh rate of the monitor. Virtual Vsync allows users to enjoy smooth and tear-free gaming without sacrificing performance.
 
Hyperformance is a feature that boosts the responsiveness of games by reducing the input lag and latency. It does so by eliminating redundant rendering tasks that do not contribute to the final image quality. Hyperformance works with hundreds of today's top games, including Diablo III, Mass Effect 3, Skyrim, and more.
 
Lucid Virtu MVP 2.0 is available for direct sale to all gamers, videophiles, and PC enthusiasts who own Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge motherboards, with an NVIDIA or AMD discrete graphics card, by download on the Lucid online shop[^1^]. It comes in three models: Basic with GPU virtualization for $34.99 (USD), Standard with Virtual Vsync for $44.99, and Pro with Hyperformance and Virtual Vsync for $54.99.
