## Step 1: Check your game version
 
Before you download the patch, you need to check your game version. To do this, launch Skyrim and go to the main menu. Then, press the tilde key (~) to open the console and type `getskseversion`. You should see a message that tells you the current version of your game. If it is lower than 1.9, you need to update your game.
 
## Step 2: Download the patch
 
The easiest way to download the patch is through Steam. If you have turned off auto update when you installed the steam version of Skyrim, then right click on the skyrim name in your steam games window, select properties and then the updates tab. At the top use the dropdown window and select always keep this game up to date[^1^]. Steam will automatically download and install the patch for you.
 
If you have a non-steam version of Skyrim, you can download the patch manually from various websites. However, be careful to choose a reliable and safe source. You can also use a mod manager like Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer to download and install the patch for you.
 
## Step 3: Install the patch
 
If you downloaded the patch manually, you need to extract the files and copy them to your Skyrim folder. Usually, this is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim`. Make sure to overwrite any existing files when prompted.
 
If you used a mod manager, you need to activate the patch in your mod list. Make sure it is loaded after any other mods that modify the game files.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the new features
 
Once you have installed the patch, you can launch Skyrim and enjoy the new features and bug fixes. Some of the highlights of Skyrim official patch 1.9 are:
 
- Legendary difficulty setting
- Legendary Skills â Skills of 100 can be made Legendary. This will reset the skill to 15, return its Perks and allow the skill to affect leveling again. This effectively removes the overall level cap.
- Bug fixes for general stability and memory optimizations
- Bug fixes for quest progression issues
- Bug fixes for combat balance and AI behavior
- Bug fixes for various graphical glitches and sound errors

## Step 5: Update your mods
 
If you use mods for Skyrim, you might need to update them as well to make them compatible with the patch. Some mods might not work properly or cause crashes if they are outdated. To update your mods, you can use the same method as you used to download them. Either use Steam Workshop, a mod manager or a manual download.
 
However, before you update your mods, make sure to backup your save files and your mod list. This way, you can restore them in case something goes wrong. You can also use a tool like LOOT to sort your load order and check for any conflicts or errors.
 
## Step 6: Have fun!
 
Now that you have updated your game and your mods, you are ready to explore the world of Skyrim with the latest patch. You can try out the new difficulty setting, level up your skills to legendary status, or just enjoy the improved performance and stability. Skyrim official patch 1.9 is a great update that makes the game more enjoyable and immersive.
